# Startup Opener

Startup Opener is an app using Win32.

## Features

Startup Opener can:
  **Add apps to startup** - Startup Opener is specifically designed to save you a few clicks by opening them automatically at either logon or startup.
  **Remove apps from startup** - Startup Opener and its creators does not want you to be molested, so we included removing apps from startup.
  **Edit existing startup apps** - Startup Opener can let you edit current startup apps.
Startup Opener can**not**:
  **Manage services** - Startup Opener cannot manage services that start with the system. It focuses specifically on user-defined startup applications.
  **Modify system settings** - It does not have access to modify system settings or configurations beyond the startup applications list.
  **Automate startup decisions** - While it can add, remove, and edit startup applications, it does not automate the decision-making process for which applications should start with the system. This is left to the   user's discretion.
  **Handle non-Win32 applications** - As it's built using Win32, Startup Opener may not be compatible with applications or systems outside of the Windows environment.
